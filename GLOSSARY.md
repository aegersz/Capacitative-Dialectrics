# Glossary of Terms for Understanding Capacitor Energy Storage

This glossary provides simple explanations of key terms used in the context of how a capacitor stores, holds, and releases electrical energy.

## Key Terms

**Capacitor:** An electronic component that stores electrical energy in an electric field. Think of it like a small, temporary battery.

**Dielectric:** An insulating material (like plastic, ceramic, or air) placed between the conductive plates of a capacitor. It prevents direct electrical contact between the plates and helps the capacitor store more energy. Imagine it as a barrier that can still be influenced by electrical forces.

**Electrodes (Plates):** The conductive surfaces (usually metal) inside a capacitor where electrical charges accumulate. These are the "shelves" where the electrical energy is stored.

**Electric Field:** An invisible force field created by the presence of electric charges. It's the region around a charged object where another charged object would experience a force. Think of it like the magnetic field around a magnet.

**Voltage:** An electrical pressure that pushes electric charges through a circuit. It's the "force" that causes electricity to flow. Measured in volts (V).

**Charge:** A fundamental property of matter that can be either positive or negative. Electrons carry a negative charge, and protons carry a positive charge. Measured in Coulombs (C).

**Current:** The flow of electric charge through a circuit. It's like the amount of water flowing through a pipe. Measured in Amperes (A).

**Energy:** The ability to do work. In this context, it's the electrical energy stored in the capacitor. Measured in Joules (J).

**Polarization (in a Dielectric):** The process where the atoms or molecules within the dielectric material rearrange themselves in response to an electric field.
    * **Dipole:** A molecule or atom that has a separation of positive and negative electrical charges, like a tiny bar magnet with a north and south pole.
    * When an electric field is applied, these dipoles either align with the field (if they already exist) or are created by the field. This alignment helps store more energy in the capacitor.

**Permittivity:** A measure of how easily an electric field can form in a material. Dielectric materials with higher permittivity allow capacitors to store more charge (and thus more energy) at a given voltage. Think of it as how "receptive" the dielectric is to the electric field.

**AC (Alternating Current):** An electric current that periodically reverses direction and changes its magnitude over time. This is the type of electricity used in most homes.

**DC (Direct Current):** An electric current that flows in only one direction. Batteries provide DC electricity.

**Capacitance (C):** A measure of a capacitor's ability to store electric charge for a given voltage. A higher capacitance means the capacitor can store more charge at the same voltage. Measured in Farads (F).

**Reactance (in AC circuits):** The opposition of a circuit element (like a capacitor or inductor) to the flow of alternating current. Capacitive reactance ($X_C$) decreases as the frequency of the AC signal or the capacitance increases.

**Leakage Current:** A small, unwanted current that flows through the dielectric material or across the terminals of a real capacitor, causing it to slowly lose its stored charge over time.

This glossary should provide a basic understanding of the terms involved in how capacitors function.
